🛰️ Project 01 – Static Routing Configuration
📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to configure Static Routing in a multi-router Ethernet-based network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Static routing enables administrators to manually define routes for data transmission across routers — providing simplicity, predictability, and control for smaller networks.

🧩 Objectives

Connect three routers using Ethernet links.

Assign appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks to all interfaces.

Establish connectivity between three different LAN networks using Static Routes.

Verify communication between all devices using ping and traceroute.

🖥️ Network Topology
Device	Interface	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Connected To
Router1	G0/0	10.1.1.1	255.255.255.0	PC1
	G0/1	12.1.1.1	255.255.255.0	Router2
Router2	G0/0	20.1.1.1	255.255.255.0	PC2
	G0/1	12.1.1.2	255.255.255.0	Router1
	G0/2	23.1.1.1	255.255.255.0	Router3
Router3	G0/0	30.1.1.1	255.255.255.0	PC3
	G0/1	23.1.1.2	255.255.255.0	Router2

⚙️ Device Requirements

Routers: Cisco 2811 (3 units)

End Devices: 3 PCs

Connections: Ethernet Auto (Straight/Auto Cable)

Software: Cisco Packet Tracer

🧾 Configuration Steps
1️⃣ Configure IP Addresses

Example (on Router1):

Router1> enable
Router1# configure terminal
Router1(config)# interface g0/0
Router1(config-if)# ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router1(config-if)# no shutdown

Router1(config)# interface g0/1
Router1(config-if)# ip address 12.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
Router1(config-if)# no shutdown


Perform similar configurations on Router2 and Router3 according to the table above.

2️⃣ Configure Static Routes

Router1:

ip route 20.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 12.1.1.2
ip route 30.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 12.1.1.2


Router2:

ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 12.1.1.1
ip route 30.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 23.1.1.2


Router3:

ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 23.1.1.1
ip route 20.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 23.1.1.1

3️⃣ Verify Connectivity

Use ping from PC1 to PC3:

PC1> ping 30.1.1.10


Use traceroute to confirm the routing path:

PC1> tracert 30.1.1.10


✅ If all replies are successful, static routing is configured properly.

💡 Additional Tasks

Try these enhancements:

Default static route (for unknown destinations):

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 12.1.1.2


Floating static route (backup route):

ip route 20.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 23.1.1.2 5

📊 Verification Commands
Command	Description
show ip route	Displays static and connected routes
show ip interface brief	Verifies interface IP and status
show running-config	Displays router configuration
ping	Tests network reachability
traceroute	Displays hop-by-hop route path
🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will:

Master manual static route configuration on multiple routers.

Understand next-hop IP routing using Ethernet links.

Develop IP addressing and subnetting skills.

Learn to verify, test, and troubleshoot static routes effectively.

🧠 Key Takeaways

Static routing provides manual control and is ideal for small, stable topologies.

It does not adapt automatically to topology changes — that’s where dynamic routing (like OSPF) comes in.

Understanding static routing deeply builds a strong foundation for OSPF and EIGRP.
