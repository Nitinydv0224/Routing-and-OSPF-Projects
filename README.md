🧭 Routing and OSPF Projects

This repository contains a collection of Cisco Networking projects focused on Routing configurations and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol implementation.
Each project demonstrates real-world networking scenarios using Cisco Packet Tracer, involving static routing, dynamic routing, and OSPF multi-area configurations between routers.

📘 Overview

The main goal of these projects is to understand and configure inter-router communication using both Static Routing and Dynamic Routing (OSPF) techniques.
It simulates how routers share routing information and forward packets efficiently across multiple networks.

🧩 Key Learning Objectives

Understand how routers build and maintain routing tables.

Configure Static Routing using:

Next-hop IP

Exit Interface

Both combined

Implement OSPF Routing:

Single Area OSPF

Multi-Area OSPF

Router ID configuration

Cost, priority, and network command usage

Verify connectivity using ping, traceroute, and show commands.

Learn network design and IP addressing schemes.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Cisco Packet Tracer – Network simulation

Routers: Cisco 2811 (with serial interfaces)

Routing Protocols: Static, OSPF

Cables: Auto cables (instead of serial DCE/DTE)
